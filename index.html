    <about-me>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a young software developer living in the north of Germany...
            <br>
            well actually that's false, I mean I'm young and I'm living in 
            Germany but that's it. But I'm not completely stupid I've 
            wrote a few lines of code in my life as you can see on my 
            GitHub and obviously  I wrote the html and css Documents for 
            this Website. As you might have guessed already I like nearly 
            everything around the topic IT and I hope that I will have 
            to opportunity to become a Developer or a penetration tester.
