            <p>
                On my GitHub I post mainly code I wrote and from wich I think 
                somebody else could use it too. Additionally it is also the 
                place where this Website and my Blog lives on, so you can 
                fell free to have a look on the source code of my Website 
                that could help you if you also want to start building a 
                Website.
