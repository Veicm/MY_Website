                On my GitHub I post mainly code I wrote and from wich I think 
                somebody else could use it too. Additionally it is also the 
                place where this Website and my Blog lives on, so you can 
                fell free to have a look on the source code of my Website 
                that could help you if you also want to start building a 
                Website.

                On my Reddit account you can see what I'm 
                interested in and what I lough about. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't want to lie to you I'm not sure if this is interesting 
                for anyone but I thought it would be the best to add this 
                also just to have everything at one place, but I would be 
                happy if you would visit my page and lough about one of my 
                posts.
