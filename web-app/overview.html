                On this page you can find Web Applications, I wrote mainly for practice but some of them may have also a real usage. 
                So fell free to use them, save them or take a look of the <a href="https://github.com/Veicm/My_Website/tree/main/web-app">source code</a>.

                    This is a nice little Calculator I wrote. It's not very 
                    complicated or efficient but It's awesome.
